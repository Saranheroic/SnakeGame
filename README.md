Project Title: Snake Game in JavaScript

Project Description:
I developed a classic Snake Game using JavaScript, HTML5, and the canvas element. The game features a dynamic user interface with responsive controls for the snake's movement. Players navigate a growing snake, aiming to consume randomly generated food items to score points. The game incorporates key features such as a score tracker, responsive controls, and an intuitive reset function. The implementation showcases proficiency in JavaScript, event handling, and game logic. Additionally, the project emphasizes clean code structure, making it easily maintainable and extensible. This Snake Game project serves as a demonstration of my ability to create engaging and interactive web applications.
